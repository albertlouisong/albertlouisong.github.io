            <h4>UTS Food Appreciation Society App (Android Studio) [Java]</h4>
            <img class="imgpre2" src="img/foodsoc1.png" alt="Foodsoc Application Homescreen"><img class="imgpre2" src="img/foodsoc2.png" alt="Foodsoc Application Reimbursement Request Screen">
            <p class="project">The UTS Food Appreciation Society App is an Android mobile application I developed individually in Android Studio to handle reimbursement requests for committee members in the UTS Food Appreciation Society. It allows members to request reimbursements for purchases they have made in relation to the society's events through the application. Request data is uploaded to an online database, where it can be accessed and approved by executive members of the society. The data related to the transaction is also uploaded in a form that is consistent with the receipts template used by the society. As a result, the table of receipts held in the online database can just be copied and pasted into the receipts spreadsheet on the society's Google Drive, automating the tedious manual input of data that was previously required. This project was developed using the Java programming language along with the Google Firebase API for real-time databases and storage. Objects for reimbursement requests, receipts, and society events were constructed in Java and converted into JSON data using the Firebase API where it was stored in a JSON tree, allowing it to be exported as a Comma Separated Value file, which can be interpreted as spreadsheet data.</p>

            <p class="project">The Hide and Seek Multiplayer Game is a 3D multiplayer game developed in the Unity Game Engine for my 'Introduction to Computer Game Programming' major project at UTS. It is a sound based game where one team of up to 7 players attempt to run away from a single 'seeker' player until they reach the required amount of steps to win. The 'seeker' wins the game by finding and attacking all 'hider' players before they reach the required amount of steps. Visibility of the opposing team is intentionally limited so that players must rely on the sound of their opponent's footsteps to determine their movement and location. This project was developed using the C# programming language with Unity APIs. It was a group project where I was solely responsible for level design, and contributed towards programming for network activity, animations and movement.</p>

            <p class="project">Seasons of Change is a 2D side-scroller game developed in the Unity Game Engine for my 'Introduction to Computer Game Design' major project at UTS. It is a platformer game where you play as a supernatural being that gains powers based on the four seasons. This project was developed using the C# programming language with Unity APIs. It was a group project where I was responsible for level design and programming for movement, attacking and interaction between game objects. It received a high distinction mark.</p>

              <img class="imgpre1" src="img/conductorcannon1.png" alt="Conductor Cannon Screenshot">
            <p class="project">Conductor Cannon is a music-based sandbox audiovisual application developed in the Processing IDE for my 'Interactive Media' major project at UTS. It is a game where Kinect input is used to control a moving cannon locked on a horizontal plane to shoot blocks at the top of the screen. Shooting blocks activates them, creating an environmental object and playing an audio loop. The numerous possible combinations of active blocks allows for many unique combinations of visual environments and pleasant music created by the user. This project was developed using the Java programming language with the Beads Audio and Microsoft Kinect input APIs. It was a group project where I was solely responsible for programming audio interactions using the Beads audio library. It received a high distinction mark.</p>
